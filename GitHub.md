## GitHub 

What is GitHub?

GitHub is a collaboration platform that uses Git for versioning. GitHub is a popular place to share and contribute to open-source software.

What is a repository?

A repository is a project containing files and folders. A repository tracks versions of files and folders.

What is a branch?

A branch is a parallel version of your repository. By default, your repository has one branch named main and it is considered to be the definitive branch. Creating additional branches allows you to copy the main branch of your repository and safely make any changes without disrupting the main project. Many people use branches to work on specific features without affecting any other parts of the project.

Branches allow you to separate your work from the main branch. In other words, everyone's work is safe while you contribute.
What is a profile README?: A profile README is essentially an "About me" section on your GitHub profile where you can share information about yourself with the community on GitHub.com. GitHub shows your profile README at the top of your profile page.

What is a pull request?

Collaboration happens on a pull request. The pull request shows the changes in your branch to other people and allows people to accept, reject, or suggest additional changes to your branch. In a side by side comparison, this pull request is going to keep the changes you just made on your branch and propose applying them to the main project branch.

## GitHub 

Its the largest , most complete development platform in the world. 
Millions of developers use it. 
And its not just developers. 
These days , every company is a software company. 
I thought you might say that. 
Come on , let me show you.  
GitHub is an enterprise transforming, Startup launching, community driven, super secure, open source championing, cloud based platform. 
Its where the world builds software. 
We created algorithms, and global businesses.  
We even went to Mars, or at least our code did. 
With GitHub anything is possible. 
But how ?
Say this is Sonal, as senior Software Engineer. And this is the teams project on GitHub. 
Sonal and the team  can create their own brunches of code to work together in parallel. 
This is my brunch. An alternate timeline where i can build , squash bugs, and safely experiment. 
There are communication and test delegation tools, right next to my code. So when were ready to merge ,we merge. 
Instantly it works with thousand of branches for over a million projects. And with built in project planning automation , CI/CD and AI enhanced code editing at every step, you can move fast and get your ducks in a row but we gotta be safe about it. Github has advanced security of automatic vulnerability detection , secret scanning and more. So we can build and ship safely and securely, so now you know what GitHub is , you might wonder  who GitHub is its a student learning to code , its disrupters , revolutionising music its a CEO transforming a global company. 
Its 21,000 strangers working together, to take the first picture of a black hole , its a place for anyone from anywhere to build anything , anything you think the world needs.
