## GitHub 





Its the largest , most complete development platform in the world. 
Millions of developers use it. 
And its not just developers. 
These days , every company is a software company. 
I thought you might say that. 
Come on , let me show you.  
GitHub is an enterprise transforming, Startup launching, community driven, super secure, open source championing, cloud based platform. 
Its where the world builds software. 
We created algorithms, and global businesses.  
We even went to Mars, or at least our code did. 
With GitHub anything is possible. 
But how ?
Say this is Sonal, as senior Software Engineer. And this is the teams project on GitHub. 
Sonal and the team  can create their own brunches of code to work together in parallel. 
This is my brunch. An alternate timeline where i can build , squash bugs, and safely experiment. 
There are communication and test delegation tools, right next to my code. So when were ready to merge ,we merge. 
Instantly it works with thousand of branches for over a million projects. And with built in project planning automation , CI/CD and AI enhanced code editing at every step, you can move fast and get your ducks in a row but we gotta be safe about it. Github has advanced security of automatic vulnerability detection , secret scanning and more. So we can build and ship safely and securely, so now you know what GitHub is , you might wonder  who GitHub is its a student learning to code , its disrupters , revolutionising music its a CEO transforming a global company. 
Its 21,000 strangers working together, to take the first picture of a black hole , its a place for anyone from anywhere to build anything , anything you think the world needs.
