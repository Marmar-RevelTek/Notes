## Universal Business Framework

The Universal Business Framework (UBF) is a set of guidelines and standards developed by the United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT) to facilitate electronic data exchange in international trade.

The UBF is designed to provide a standardized framework for the exchange of electronic business messages, such as purchase orders, invoices, and shipping notices, between different organizations involved in international trade. The UBF includes a set of standard data elements and message structures that are intended to be used by all parties involved in electronic trade transactions.

The goal of the UBF is to simplify and streamline the process of electronic trade transactions by providing a common language and framework for the exchange of data between different systems and platforms. This can help to reduce errors, improve efficiency, and lower costs associated with international trade.

The UBF is used by many organizations and governments around the world as a basis for their electronic trade facilitation initiatives. It is regularly updated and refined to reflect changes in business practices and technology.
