## Universal Business Framework

The Universal Business Framework (UBF) is a set of guidelines and standards developed by the United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT) to facilitate electronic data exchange in international trade.

The UBF is designed to provide a standardized framework for the exchange of electronic business messages, such as purchase orders, invoices, and shipping notices, between different organizations involved in international trade. The UBF includes a set of standard data elements and message structures that are intended to be used by all parties involved in electronic trade transactions.

The goal of the UBF is to simplify and streamline the process of electronic trade transactions by providing a common language and framework for the exchange of data between different systems and platforms. This can help to reduce errors, improve efficiency, and lower costs associated with international trade.

The UBF is used by many organizations and governments around the world as a basis for their electronic trade facilitation initiatives. It is regularly updated and refined to reflect changes in business practices and technology.

## THE SUMMURIZE OF THE UBF: 


The Universal Business Framework (UBF) is a tool used in consulting for Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A), and large-scale project management. It offers a way to understand, predict, and direct large decisions across entire industries, using a relational and structural perspective similar to that of the universe. The UBF includes a classification system that maps and observes galaxies, black holes, solar systems, stars, superstars, moons, comets, and asteroids within industries, aiding in informed decision-making. The framework is used by organizations that have adopted SWARM Intelligence, Agile Methodology, and DROID Ops. DROID Ops includes classifications such as galaxies, black holes, solar systems, stars, superstars, moons, comets, and asteroids within industries.

The Universal Business Framework (UBF) is a tool that aids in enterprise resource planning (ERP), mergers and acquisitions (M&A), and large-scale project management. It views industries and businesses from a relational and structural perspective, allowing for confident understanding, prediction, and direction of large decisions across entire industries. The UBF maps and observes S.T.A.R.s (small companies or projects) along their course while aiding in navigating obstacles in a defined manner. The framework includes a classification system to easily understand the structure and dynamics of the galaxies within industries. The UBF is used by organizations that have adopted SWARM Intelligence, Agile Methodology, and DROID Ops (the latest DevOps and MLOps framework). The DROID Ops framework includes the following classifications: galaxy (an entire industry), black hole (the largest corporation in the industry), super nova (a corporate cosmic-shifting event), solar system (companies organized by holding companies), sun (the largest publicly visible company inside a solar system or the headquarters of an organization), super star (a flagship or role model company), star (a small company or project), moon (an orbital, side project, startup, subsidiary, or department), comet (an unstable project that needs better planning or avoidance), and asteroid (same as a comet).

Galaxy- Entire Industry
Black Hole- Biggest company in the industry/ Largest competitor
Super Nova- Event that brings shift _ A shift that can be felt in the entire Galaxy (entire industry)
Solar System- Categories / sub part of Galaxy. Different solar systems makes Galaxy. Each solar system is dependend on eachother.
Sun- The largest publicly visible company inside a solar system or the headquarters of an organization.
Super STAR- Role model company or growing project.
STAR- A small company
MOON- Side project or Startup or department or Orbital. We define Moon using ORBITAL System
COMET- Unstable project/company that needs planning
ASTEROID- Unstable project/company that needs planning
1. Galaxy:
This section defines a business galaxy as an entire industry, with interconnected companies, organizations, and stakeholders offering similar products or services and competing for the same customers. The companies within a galaxy are constantly evolving, with new companies appearing and older ones either consolidating or going out of business.

2. Black Hole:
The Black Hole is the largest company inside a NAICS Code and is at the center of every galaxy, exerting a powerful influence on its subsidiaries, affiliated companies, competitors, and even the sparks of new ideas in that sector.

3. Super Nova:
This is a large event that can be felt across the entire industry.

4. Solar System:
Companies in a business galaxy are organized into Solar Systems based on their size, market share, and SIC codes. The different solar systems within a galaxy are often interconnected and dependent on each other in various ways, and changes in one part of the galaxy can have significant ripple effects throughout the rest of the industry.

5. Sun:
The largest publicly visible company inside a solar system or the headquarters of an organization.

6. Super Star:
A flagship or role model company that could one day become a sun. This could also be a fast-growing project that is gaining momentum and achieves many objectives.

7. Star:
A small company or project defined by S.T.A.R.s (more information included in the S.T.A.R. Guide).

8. Moon:
This refers to Orbital, Side Project, Startup, Subsidiary, or department defined using the O.R.B.I.T.A.L. Framework.

9. Comet:
An unstable project that needs better planning or avoidance.

10. Asteroid:
Same as a comet.
