## pie chart

A pie chart is a circular statistical graphic that is divided into slices to represent numerical proportions or percentages of a whole. It is named after its resemblance to a sliced pie, where each slice represents a different category or component of the data being presented.

Here are the key features of a pie chart:

Circle: The chart is circular in shape, representing the whole data set or 100% of the values being analyzed.

Slices: The circle is divided into individual slices or sectors, each corresponding to a specific category or data point. The size of each slice is proportional to the value it represents.

Labels: Each slice is usually labeled to indicate the category it represents. The labels are placed either inside or outside the corresponding slice, typically with lines connecting them to the chart.

Colors: Different colors or shades are used to fill each slice, making it easier to differentiate between the categories visually.

Legend: A legend is often included to provide a key for interpreting the colors or patterns used in the chart. It lists the categories and their corresponding colors or patterns.

Pie charts are commonly used to visualize data with discrete categories and show the proportion or percentage distribution of each category within the whole. They are especially useful when comparing the relative sizes of different categories and identifying the dominant or minority components of a dataset at a glance.
