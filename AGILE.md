## AGILE 

 agile is an interative approach to project managment and software development ,
 that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches.
 instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small , but consumable , increments.
 requirements,plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly .
