## The terms "ethics" and "compliance" get tossed out a lot these days, often used interchangeably when talking about businesses doing the right thing. While they certainly both strive to achieve similar goals, they are not quite the same thing. If you want to enhance your corporate culture, it helps to understand the connection between the two, as well as the subtle nuances that set them apart.

	² Difference Between Ethics and Compliance

It's important to draw some distinctions between the terms "ethics" and "compliance." Certainly, they are related, but they are not the same thing. Take a look at these ethics and compliance definitions to gain some clarity.

Ethics is "the decisions, choices, and actions (behaviors) we make that reflect and enact our values," says the Ethics and Compliance Initiative.

But ECI also points out that ethics encompasses other nuances, such as this definition from Stephen
D. Potts, author The Ethics of Non-profit Management: "A set of standards of conduct that guide decisions and actions based on duties derived from core values."

Compliance is "conforming or adapting one's actions to another's wishes, to a rule or to necessity," says ECI. So, while you might be meeting compliance standards, your motivation to do so might be to stay within the law rather than because you think it's morally the correct action to take.


	² Importance of Ethics in corporation culture .

Assuming you are more interested in creating a good culture as opposed to avoiding a negative
culture (bad ethics = bad culture), what are the benefits of ethics influencing corporate culture?

⭐️ morale Boosts. ⭐️Employees want to work for a boss they can trust. Ditto for working alongside fellow employees who are both honest and honorable. Employees want to feel safe, secure, encouraged, valued, and respected. We all want that. Fostering an ethical compliance culture enhances all of these elements of a positive, thriving corporate environment and thus improves employee morale.

⭐️ Misconduct declines.⭐️ When you establish a code of conduct that outlines expectations of fair treatment and ethical behavior, you provide employees with the standards they can use to conduct themselves in a professional manner. This written code often goes beyond what the law requires, and it provides a solid foundation for building a culture of respect, trust, transparency , and accountability. 


⭐️ Increases productivity.⭐️ Research shows that "upholding ethical practices in the offices enhances better performance of the office manager," especially when the code of conduct aligns with employees' personal values.

⭐️ Improves compliance. ⭐️ While an action or behavior might be legal, it is not always ethical. A focus on business ethics is at the underpinning of legal compliance. You need both to build and sustain a culture of ethical compliance, as they go hand in hand. The more you communicate your values and principles, provide training to reflect them, and hold every employee accountable, the more you decrease your risks and increase your compliance.

In this era of trust-driven pudhase and partnership decisions, any association with corruption is detrimental to businesses. But how is trust established, and what are the benefits to a company?
There are internal and external costs of corruption to a business and you must become literate in how these costs can be avoided through establishing trust practices.

Trust is an asset that companies can establish through best practices. Trust can take a lifetime to build yet can be destroyed in an instant. The world's perception of trustworthiness colors everything that people and enterprises say or do. In enterprise, trusted relationships inspire confidence, efficiencies, and cost savings. IDC finds, based on the results of a May 2021 global survey, that 82% of companies believe that organizational trust (internal and external) is necessary for success. Trust elevates business success.

Consumers and suppliers alike want to feel good about their business relationships. Trusted relationships can often validate the feeling that what one is doing is good and just. Enterprises should be aware that every business decision made has an impact on trust. Honest, ethical, and trusted behavior elevates the quality of business relationships. If the quality of a business relationship is elevated through trust, it is just as easily eroded by corruption (see Figure 1).
Corruption of any form drains an organization's trust.
