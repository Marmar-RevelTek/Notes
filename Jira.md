Managing work in Jira helps your team be more transparent, efficient, and collaborative. 

Transparency means everyone on your team can see what work is getting done. Efficiency means your team can plan ahead by knowing exactly when work will start and end. Collaboration means working closely with your teammates, keeping discussions and comments well-organized.

There are two main roles in Jira: users and administrators
Jira user can only track and manage your daily work and won't be able to setting up new Jira projects. Or adjusting any advanced settings. Your Jira administrator or team leader will take care of that for you.

In Jira, a work item is called an issue/  issues are the work items you'll update to show progress or add relevant information.
